# SPARQLab

SPARQLab is a lab for exercising the SPARQL query language. Your task in SPARQLab is to formulate SPARQL queries that produce results satisfying the given requirements. Each exercise is provided with an exemplary solution. The application is based on data on pension statistics from the Czech social security administration. The exercises focus on data exploration, such as for finding the dimensions used in the data, but also on domain-specific analyses, such as for detecting regions with the largest pay gap between male and female retirees.
